# Auto Citicon
This tool uses RedM's Citicon file to automatically convert ydr files which are made for FiveM into ydr files that work with RedM instead.
So instead of having to manually convert every single file, you can now just run this tool and it converts every single ydr file in a folder in just a couple seconds.
